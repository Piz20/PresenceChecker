A new screen will appear. It allows you to determine your location in relation to your organization\'s premises:\n\n

*If you are outside the perimeter of your structure , you will be redirected to a page to send an absence form.\n\n

*If you are inside the perimeter of your structure, you will click on the \"I am present"\ button.\n\n


Note: Reporting of presence can only be done from 10:00 a.m. to 10:59 a.m. and from 3:00 p.m. to 3:59 p.m.\n\n
